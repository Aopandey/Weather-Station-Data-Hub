# What is this Project?
This project is a Flask-based web application designed
for serving weather station data, including 
temperatures on specific dates, all available data
for a station, and data filtered by year. It 
showcases the use of Flask for web development 
and Pandas for data handling, providing a practical
example of how to build a simple data-driven web 
API.
